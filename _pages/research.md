## Research interests

My research lies at the intersection of food policy, public economics, and applied microeconometrics. 
A central theme of my work is how institutional design and administrative frictions shape program participation, policy effectiveness, and heterogeneous responses across regions and populations.

Substantively, I focus on:
- SNAP eligibility rules, work requirements, and administrative burden
- State discretion, waiver design, and federal gatekeeping
- Emerging food policies, including purchase restrictions and cultivated meat regulation

Methodologically, I combine quasi-experimental designs, event studies, and machine-learning–assisted heterogeneity analysis using large administrative datasets and original policy-text corpora.

## Working papers

### Projected SNAP Caseload Losses under Expanded ABAWD Work Requirements  
*(Draft)*

This paper develops an ex-ante forecasting framework to quantify heterogeneous SNAP participation losses under expanded ABAWD work requirements. Using Michigan’s staggered reinstatement as a quasi-experimental setting, I estimate county-level vulnerability to administratively driven exits and construct risk maps to inform targeted outreach and policy design.

### Administrative Frictions, Calorie-and-Sugar Policy Hardness, and Federal Gatekeeping in MAHA-Era SNAP Purchase-Restriction Waivers  
*(In progress)*

I assemble a reproducible policy-document corpus spanning state waiver applications, federal approval letters, and implementation guidance to study how administrative constraints shape the nutritional stringency and implementation speed of SNAP purchase-restriction waivers.

### Regulatory Fragmentation and Market-Entry Risk in Cultivated Meat  
*(Draft)*

Using a newly constructed state-level policy database covering U.S. cultivated meat policies from 2018–2025, this paper examines agenda entry, regulatory escalation, and the economic implications of state-level policy fragmentation for market entry and supply chains.
