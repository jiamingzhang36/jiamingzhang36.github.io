I am a PhD student in Agricultural, Food, and Resource Economics at Michigan State University (expected May 2028).

My research interests lie in food policy and applied econometrics, with a focus on how institutional design and administrative frictions shape program participation and policy effectiveness. I work with large-scale administrative and panel datasets related to SNAP, Medicaid, and labor market conditions.

Previously, I worked as a research assistant at Purdue University on projects spanning Difference-in-Differences analyses of natural disasters and domestic violence, machine-learning applications in food-delivery data, predictive modeling of post-pandemic food choices, and large-scale data collection using Python web crawlers (Beautiful Soup, Selenium).

**Technical skills:** R, Python, Stata, LaTeX; causal inference; machine learning.
