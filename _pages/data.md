## Data

### Cultivated Meat Policy Database (CMPD)
I constructed a comprehensive state-level policy database covering approximately 170 legislative and administrative documents related to cultivated meat in the United States from 2018–2025. The database codes policy instruments, regulatory intensity, and timing of agenda entry and escalation.

- Coverage: U.S. states, 2018–2025  
- Sources: Introduced bills, substitutes, enacted statutes, and administrative rules  
- Status: Research use; public release in preparation

### Michigan SNAP County-Month Panel
I assembled a county-level panel dataset for Michigan SNAP participation, integrating administrative caseload data with labor market indicators, demographic controls, and policy timing variables related to ABAWD work requirements and waiver rollouts.

- Frequency: County-month  
- Coverage: 2016–2019  
- Access: Restricted; replication materials available upon request

## Code

Most replication code is written in **R** and **Python**, using modern tools for causal inference and heterogeneity analysis, including event-study designs, difference-in-differences estimators, and machine-learning–assisted methods.

Selected repositories (to be updated):
- SNAP policy analysis and forecasting (R)
- Cultivated meat policy coding and analysis (R / Python)
